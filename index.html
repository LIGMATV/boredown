This is an nice idea to simply writing in Markdown without feel stupid for just knowing basic.   
**Just knowing Markdown?** Yeah, just write with it without any complicating features. **Knowing HTML?** Create the template become what you want. **Knowing Javascript?** Change anything what you want. **Knowing ChatGPT?** Ask him.

Boredown was fully using [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering all markdown-styled text like **bold**, _italic_, ~~striked~~. If you're a mad at math, than you're in good company. With Boredown, you can write math by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

Boredown has some basic features:
- ⚡ Fast load
- 🐥 Nice for all use
- 👁️ Static but flawless
- 🎨 Customize at all
- 📝 Use data from frontmatter
- ➗ Support math syntax
